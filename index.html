      <h2 id="description">Course Description</h2>
      This is a self taught course, designed to be read and discussed in small group settings.<Br>
      <br>
      Many of us are already aware of injustices in our world, often with a vague sense of their histories. But how exactly did we arrive here, what freedoms and powers have we gained, and how much further do we have to go? What role did ordinary working people take in challenging power and creating autonomy in their own situations? What worked and why? From all of this, what can be done in our local and global communities in the 21st century?
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sample the last 150 years of labor movements and popular struggles
        <li>Examine the role of autonomy and prefigurative politics in those movements
        <li>Critique and discuss the outcomes of these actions
        <li>Research and discuss contemporary examples of struggle
        <li>talk shit on capitalism
      </ul>

      <h2 id="about">About</h2>
      I've long felt that despite the manifold capabilities of the web, there is very little critical and historical material created for beginners.
      I believe focusing on short and inspiring texts is absolutely key in our age of memes and interlaced attentions. Creating community and discussion is as important as learning your history, so these pieces are also thought of in the context of a self-run class.
      Organizing the class and taking your community's education into your own hands can be a starting point for a manifold of myriad of actions.<br><br>
